For this model I have sifted through numerous different models like the machine learning model, the logistic regession, and a couple trees.
Weighing out the pros and cons of each of these, I have decided to use the RandomForest model. This is because it doesn't take as long to train as the multilayerperceptron model, 
and is more accurate than most of the models like the logistic regression and the other trees.

I have cross validated the training set with itself to get a slight idea of the amount of overfitting that may occur, and found that the RandomForest 
model was pretty accurate in that regard (97% accuracy).
