## :material-hammer-wrench: Customizable & Extensible

ngUML provides a basic structure and metadata to store UML-based requirements texts, and to build a relational model from this. The runtime
for the demo applications is separate and is not a main goal of this open source project. We offer a proprietary runtime that brings a more
enterprise ready experience for modeled applications, you are however free to link your own runtime.

## :material-lock-open: Always Open

Licensed under BSL 1.1, meaning that the work is at the time of writing open to use as long it is not used for commercial purposes. You can,
in a business or research group, use the tool internally and for your own benefit, but you are not allowed to deploy or configure the application 
for customers through a commercial operation.

## :material-language-python: Powered by Python

ngUML is heavily based on the [Django](http://www.djangoproject.com/) framework. Developers can leverage existing experience to extend ngUML.
