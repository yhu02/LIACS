## Design Philosophy

ngUML was designed with the following tenets foremost in mind.

### Keep it Simple

When given a choice between a relatively simple [80% solution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle) and a much more complex complete solution, the former will typically be favored. This ensures a lean codebase with a low learning curve.

## Application Stack

ngUML is built on the [Django](https://djangoproject.com/) Python framework and utilizes a [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) database. It runs as a WSGI service behind your choice of HTTP server.

| Function           | Component         |
|--------------------|-------------------|
| HTTP service       | nginx or Apache   |
| WSGI service       | gunicorn or uWSGI |
| Application        | Django/Python     |
| Database           | PostgreSQL 10+    |
| Task queuing       | Redis/django-rq   |
