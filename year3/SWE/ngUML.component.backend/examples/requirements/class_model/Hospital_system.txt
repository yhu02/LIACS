“Patients will initially visit their doctor when they are ill. The doctor will then
diagnose the patients and write a report. The diagnosis can be a physical
one, a psychological one or a psychiatric one. The report contains illness
conditions, diagnostic result, and suggestions that are for treatment. If the
doctor suggests medication, the report will list the specific drugs. The
patient will then collect their drugs from the pharmacy, and pay for the bill. If
the doctor suggests an operation, the patient will be requested to make an
appointment for the operation with the hospital. A surgeon and an operation
team are assigned to perform the operation. A surgeon typically performs
multiple operations on a particular day. Following the operation, the patient
will receive care in the hospital. Care can involve physiotherapy,
osteotherapy or mental support. The patients will be assigned a bed that is
on a ward, and will be cared for by nurses. A nurse will care for several
patients.”
