The online shopping system allows customers to search for products by
category, and to order them. Each category contains sub categories or
products. Cars, bicycles and motorbikes are sub categories. Customers can
search for products matching their search criteria. An administrator
manages the categories and product information. Customers can create
accounts. An account will consist of various information such as name,
address, phone number, email, and so on.
Customers can add one or more products to the shopping cart. The
shopping cart lists the products, and shows their price. It also shows the
total price of the items in the shopping cart. Customers can remove
products from the shopping cart before checkout.
The payment process is triggered when customers confirm the order.
Customers will pay for the products, and receive a confirmation email. The
confirmation email shows the order information. Order information consists
of customer, products, prices, quantities, delivery address, and delivery
date.
