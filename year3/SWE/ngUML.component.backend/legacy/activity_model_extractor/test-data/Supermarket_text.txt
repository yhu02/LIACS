The supermarket is organized into aisles. Each aisle contains various product categories. Food, drinks, sanitary items, and cleaning products are all product categories. Each product category contains many products. These products are stacked into shelves. Each product has a name, code, and location in the supermarket. A customer enters the supermarket, and picks up a shopping cart. The desired products will be placed in the shopping cart. The customer will then go to the cashier desk, and pay for the products. Each cashier desk has a cashier, a scanner, and a till. After receiving payment from the customer, cashiers will hand them a receipt.
