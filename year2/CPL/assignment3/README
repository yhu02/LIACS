The program has no know defects.

We implemented aplha conversion and beta reduction to simplify the parse tree.

We take a line from the input file, make tokens from this string, parse the
tokens into a tree, perform alpha conversion and beta reduction on the tree if
possible, then we check if the types of the judgement match. If they do we print
the tree, if not we give an error and exit with status 1.
